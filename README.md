Serverless Hello World

## Requirements

 You can install NodeJS version 8.10 from [official nodejs site](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/).

 I would recomend [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). It makes easy to mantain and change if you plan to play with different versions of NodeJS.

## Steps:

### Install `yarn`

```
npm i yarn -g
```

### Prepare "compile" your app

```
yarn
```

### Test the app locally

```
yarn start
```
